//Borrower Speak

//The borrowers are tiny tiny fictional people. As tiny tiny people they have to be sure they aren't spotted, or more importantly, stepped on.

//As a result, the borrowers talk very very quietly. They find that capitals and punctuation of any sort lead them to raise their voices and put them in danger.

//The young borrowers have begged their parents to stop using caps and punctuation.

//Change the input text 's' to new borrower speak. Help save the next generation!

//string체크, 대소문자로 변경, 새로운 string에 넣기
