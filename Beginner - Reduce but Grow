//Given and array of integers (x), return the result of multiplying the values together in order. Example:

//[1, 2, 3] --> 6
//For the beginner, try to use the reduce method - it comes in very handy quite a lot so is a good one to know.

//Array will not be empty.


function grow(x){
  var sum = 1;
  for(var i = 0; i < x.length; i++){
    sum = sum * x[i];
  }
  return sum;
}
